There are a number of different systems of graphology, for example, French graphology and Indian graphology. Our Founder studied Graphoanalysis at the International Graphoanalysis Society in Chicago (Graphoanalysis being an American system of graphology with different interpretations for different strokes). After completing her studies in Graphoanalysis, she researched the theories presented in this study with her students and eliminated those that were incorrect and harmful. She then developed her own Canadian system.<\/p>\n<p>Here at the Canadian Centre for Handwriting Analysis, we strive to avoid the extreme and sensational claims that have been found in over-the-counter graphology books and take a holistic approach to handwriting analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Our founder&#8217;s background in neuro and gross anatomy, nutrition, and art analysis has increased her awareness of the physical side of handwriting. Our system takes handwriting movements and emotionally significant symbols into consideration for a well-rounded approach to the analysis of handwriting.<\/p>\n<p>We have many years of experience in this system of examination and our work has taken us all over Canada. We are professional and dedicated to this holistic approach to analysis and fraud detection.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row top_margin=&#8221;0&#8243; bottom_margin=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Looking for Graphology Handwriting Analysis in Toronto or Canada?
